# PredictiveModeling_MushroomEdibility
An experimental statistics project in predicting the edibility of mushrooms using a penalized logistic regression and a random forest model in R.

This project is based on the Secondary Mushroom dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset
